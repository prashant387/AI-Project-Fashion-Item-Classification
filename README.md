# Fashion MNIST Classification using a Neural Network

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

---

## üìå Project Overview

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, each of size 28x28 pixels. This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify the images into one of the following categories:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## üß† Methodology

The project follows the standard machine learning pipeline:

1. **Dataset Loading**: 
   - The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded using `tensorflow.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Pixel values are normalized to the range `[0, 1]`.
   - Labels are one-hot encoded for training with categorical cross-entropy loss.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - A simple feedforward neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron):
     - `Flatten`: Converts 28x28 image to 784-dimensional vector.
     - `Dense(128, relu)`: Fully connected layer with 128 neurons.
     - `Dense(64, relu)`: Fully connected layer with 64 neurons.
     - `Dense(10, softmax)`: Output layer with 10 classes.

4. **Training**:
   - Optimizer: `Adam`
   - Loss Function: `categorical_crossentropy`
   - Epochs: 5
   - Validation Split: 10%

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Test accuracy
   - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
   - Confusion matrix

6. **Visualization**:
   - Bar chart for per-class recall
   - Confusion matrix heatmap
   - Optional: Sample prediction visualizations
